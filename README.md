Bank OCR Kata
==============

This is my implementation of the [Bank OCR Code Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR). This is my first Code Kata. It was actually pretty fun, and not nearly as difficult as I initially thought. I think I've done a pretty good job of implementing the functionality described for the first two user stories in a fairly simple way.

Goals for the future include using this project as a practice ground for some test-driven development (TDD) with CppUTest, and also completing at least the next couple of user stories.
